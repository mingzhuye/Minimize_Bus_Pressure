1. Save the python file as dynamic_optimize_trip.py

2. Generate two csv tables: the original trips.csv and the input2.csv, both csv files with column names.
	
		For trips.csv, 
	. Don't change the columns, just keep it original.
	
		For input2.csv,
	. The input2.csv contains columns FROM_DAY, FROM_PM, FROM_START_TIME, FROM_CAMPUS, FROM_BLDG, FROM_ROOM, VC1, VC2
	. Don't put the meetings in input2.csv, who are not shown in trips.csv or don't have virtual campus choices.
	.	For example:
		FROM_DAY,FROM_PM,FROM_START_TIME,FROM_CAMPUS,FROM_BLDG,FROM_ROOM,VC1,VC2
		M,P,0110,1,SC,123,2,3
		T,P,0140,2,ARC,103,1,3
		W,P,0640,3,BE,AUD,1,2
		H,P,0715,4,HCK,138,2,3
		F,A,0915,4,HCK,138,2,3
		
3. Run in terminal as: python dynamic_optimize_trip.py trips.csv input2.csv

4. Results shown in terminal, for example:

Start Time elapsed:  1471458069.87
For Meeting_ID:  M#P#1310#1#SC#123 , will save trips 121
For Meeting_ID:  T#P#1340#2#ARC#103 , will save trips 209
For Meeting_ID:  W#P#1840#3#BE#AUD , will save trips 335
For Meeting_ID:  H#P#1915#4#HCK#138 , will save trips 272
For Meeting_ID:  F#A#0915#4#HCK#138 , will save trips 64
For all the meetings above, total saved trips:  1001
End Time:  1471458077.8
Time elapsed:  7.93142604828

5. You may want to verify the results shown in terminal. Please go to check the output CSV File 'Dynamic_Optimize_Result.csv'.

In the output csv File, 
'Meeting_ID' means the meeting of input2.csv. Meeting_ID is generated by combining FROM_DAY, FROM_PM, FROM_START_TIME, FROM_CAMPUS, FROM_BLDG, FROM_ROOM with '#'

'RUID' means the students enrolled in the Meeting_ID

'Sorted_Schedule' means the student's daily schedule containing the Meeting_ID

'Original_Trip_Num' means the student's total daily trips for Sorted_Schedule

'VC_Choice_Route' means the student's virtual daily schedule under the optimized trip saved number

'Optimized_Trip_Num' means how many daily trips the student will have if VC_Choice_Route applied

'Saved_Trip_Num' means Original_Trip_Num minus Optimized_Trip_Num
